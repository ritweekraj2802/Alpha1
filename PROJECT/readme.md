ABSTRACT :
-

The "MIRACULOUS MIRROR " will be the magic mirror of the future and it won't just say you're the prettiest of them all. It'll also tell you the time, date, weather outside, upcoming calendar appointments, and more while you are getting ready in the morning. It's also modular, so you can easy move it around or hang it on the wall if you like. So , our team has decided to make this mirror , from scratch to market ready .

HARDWARE REQUIREMENT :

QUANTITY COMPONENT NAME
1 x Raspberry Pi 3
1 × Low profile monitor (we used an old led display)
1 × 12 ft - 1x3 plank
1 × 12ft - 1x2 plank
1 × 18" - 24" Acrylic See-Through Mirror, 1mm
1 × Wood glue
1 × Low profile HDMI cable
1.
The mirror consists of a wooden frame and a low profile monitor which sandwiches the acrylic sheet (see through mirror) to the back of the frame.
2.We built the wooden frame by glueing several pieces of 1x3 and 1x2 together.
3.Once the frame was done, we loaded some application code on the raspberry pi.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT :

1.artificial intelligence
2.Node JS

Language :

1.Python
2.Java
3.Ruby
4.Javascript

In this section , we show you how to give that smart mirror a personal artificial intelligence. The artificial intelligence has facial recognition, speech recognition, and can respond to a variety of commands. Those commands include: weather, holidays, greetings, compliments, maps, and more. You can also have it respond to you by name and configure your own launch phrase. Since the NLU (natural language understanding) is built off the popular wit.ai engine, you can train it to be even smarter.
